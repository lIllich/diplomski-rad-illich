Okay, so I need to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 80% of its phonemes from the Srednji (S) class. Let me first make sure I understand the S class correctly. From the given classes, S includes /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/. 

So, each word should be made up mostly of these phonemes. Let's start by thinking of common words that have a lot of these sounds. Maybe words with 'a', 'k', 'r', 'd', etc. 

First, "brad" comes to mind. Let's break it down. 'B' is in the N class, 'r' is S, 'a' is S, 'd' is S. So out of 4 letters, 3 are S. That's 75%, which is close but not quite 80%. Maybe I can adjust it. 

Wait, "brad" is four letters, 3 S. 3/4 is 75%, so it's just below. Maybe I can find a longer word. Let's think of "kard". 'K' is S, 'a' is S, 'r' is S, 'd' is S. That's 4/4, 100%. Perfect. 

Next, "radak". 'R' is S, 'a' is S, 'd' is S, 'a' is S, 'k' is S. All S, so 5/5, 100%. 

How about "drak"? 'D' is S, 'r' is S, 'a' is S, 'k' is S. 4/4, 100%. 

"Krad" is another one: 'K', 'r', 'a', 'd' – all S. 

"Krađa" – 'K', 'r', 'a', 'đ', 'a'. 'Đ' is in S, so all S. 

"Kafar" – 'K', 'a', 'f', 'a', 'r'. 'F' is S, so all S. 

"Kradža" – 'K', 'r', 'a', 'dž', 'a'. 'Dž' is S, so all S. 

"Draka" – 'D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'a'. All S. 

"Kraf" – 'K', 'r', 'a', 'f'. All S. 

Wait, but "kraf" is a bit short. Maybe "kraf" is okay, but perhaps a longer word would be better. Alternatively, "kraf" could be a valid word, though I'm not sure if it's commonly used. 

I think I have 10 words now, each with at least 80% S phonemes. Let me list them out again to make sure:

1. Brad – 75%, maybe not enough. I'll replace it with another word. Let's think of "brad" as 75%, so I need a word with at least 80%. Maybe "brad" is too short. Let's find another word with more letters. 

How about "drakar"? 'D', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'a', 'r'. All S. That's 6 letters, all S. So 100%. 

So replacing "brad" with "drakar", I have 10 words. 

Wait, but "drakar" might not be a common word. Maybe "kard" is better. Alternatively, "kard" is 4 letters, all S. 

I think I have enough words now, each meeting the 80% requirement. Let me compile the final list.
</think>

Here is a list of 10 Croatian words where each word contains at least 80% of its phonemes from the Srednji (S) class. Each word is carefully selected to meet the criteria:

1. **Kard** - /k/, /a/, /r/, /d/
2. **Radak** - /r/, /a/, /d/, /a/, /k/
3. **Drak** - /d/, /r/, /a/, /k/
4. **Krad** - /k/, /r/, /a/, /d/
5. **Krađa** - /k/, /r/, /a/, /đ/, /a/
6. **Kafar** - /k/, /a/, /f/, /a/, /r/
7. **Kradža** - /k/, /r/, /a/, /dž/,
