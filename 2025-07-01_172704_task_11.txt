Okay, so I've been given this task to create 10 Croatian words where each word must have at least 70% of its phonemes from the "Niski" (Low) class. The Niski class includes the phonemes /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, and /u/. 

First, I need to understand what 70% means in terms of the number of phonemes in each word. If a word has 3 phonemes, 70% would mean at least 2 of them should be from Niski. For a 4-phoneme word, at least 3 should be Niski. Similarly, for a 5-phoneme word, at least 4 should be Niski, and so on. 

Next, I should think of common word structures in Croatian. Many words start with consonants, and some have vowel endings. Since /u/ is a vowel in the Niski class, it can be used in words, but vowels from other classes like /a/, /e/, /i/, etc., should be minimized to keep the percentage high.

I'll start by listing possible Niski phonemes: /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/. Then, I can try combining these to form meaningful words. For example, "mama" is a word that consists of /m/ and /a/. But /a/ is from the Srednji class, so that's only 50% Niski, which doesn't meet the requirement. So I need to find words where most of the phonemes are from Niski.

Maybe "mim" is a word, but it's short and only has two Niski phonemes. Let me think of longer words. "Mnog" is a root meaning "many," but it's not a complete word. "Mnogo" is "many," but it includes /o/, which is Srednjeniski. So that's not good.

Perhaps I can think of words with repeated Niski phonemes. "Mm" is not a word. "Nn" is not either. Maybe "mmama" but that's not a real word. Alternatively, "mamam" is a reduplication, but again, not standard.

Wait, maybe "mud" is a word, but "mud" is "mud" in English. In Croatian, "mud" is "blato," which doesn't fit. Maybe "mud" is "mrak," but that's not right. Alternatively, "mud" could be "muča," but that includes /č/, which is Srednjevisoki.

This is tricky. Let me think of other Niski phonemes. /p/ is in "papa," but "papa" is "dad," and it includes /a/, which is Srednji. So only two Niski phonemes out of three, which is 66.6%, not enough. Maybe "ppapa" but that's not a word.

Another approach: maybe using /nj/ which is a digraph. Words like "nj" are not standalone. "Njut" is a name, but not a common word. "Njutn" is a surname. Maybe "nje" but that's a pronoun and includes /e/, which is Srednjevisoki.

Alternatively, using /b/ as in "bab" which is "dad," but again, it's short. "Baba" is "grandmother," but it includes /a/. So two Niski phonemes out of four, which is 50%.

Hmm, maybe I'm approaching this wrong. Perhaps I should think of words that are entirely made of Niski phonemes. For example, "mm" is not a word, but "mam" is "mom," which includes /m/ and /a/. Again, only one Niski phoneme.

Wait, "mm" is not a word, but "mm" as an interjection is used, but it's not a meaningful word. Maybe "mmm" as an interjection, but that's not a standard word.

Alternatively, maybe "mb" as in some loanwords, but I can't think of any Croatian words starting with "mb." 

Perhaps I'm stuck because many Croatian words include vowels from other classes. Maybe I need to consider that the vowel can be from Niski, which is /u/. So words ending with /u/ could help. For example, "mu" is a preposition meaning "to," but it's only two letters, which is 50% Niski.

"Muž" is "man," which includes /m/, /u/, and /ž/. /
