Okay, so I need to create 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 90% of its phonemes from the Visoki (V) class. The V class includes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. 

First, I should recall the structure of Croatian words. Typically, they have consonants and vowels. The V class has consonants and vowels, so I need to ensure that most of the letters in each word are from this class.

Let me think about possible combinations. Since 90% is a high percentage, each word can have at most one or two letters from other classes if the word is longer. For example, a 5-letter word can have at most one letter from a different class.

I should start by listing possible letters from the V class: Ć, I, C, Z, S. Also, vowels like I and maybe others. Wait, in the V class, vowels are only /i/, right? Because /e/ is in Srednjevisoki (SV), and /a/ is Srednji (S). So, vowels should be I to be in V.

So, consonants can be Ć, C, Z, S. Vowels can be I. Maybe other vowels if they are from V, but according to the initial list, only /i/ is in V.

Wait, the user's initial list had the V class as /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. So vowels in V are only /i/. So in the words, the vowels should be I.

Now, let's think of possible word structures. For example, starting with a consonant from V, then a vowel, then another consonant, etc.

Let me think of some examples:

1. "Ćić" – this is a word meaning "chick." It has Ć and I. Both are in V. So 100% V. Good.

2. "Cic" – but that's similar to "Ćić." Maybe "Cic" is another form, but I think it's the same.

Wait, maybe I can think of longer words. Let's try 4 letters.

3. "Cizi" – meaning "strange." C, I, Z, I. All consonants and vowels are in V. So 100%.

4. "Sić" – meaning "thorn." S, I, Ć. All V. 100%.

5. "Zic" – meaning "sow." Z, I, C. All V. 100%.

6. "Cvić" – but wait, C, V, I, Ć. V is in Srednjeniski (SN), so that's not allowed. So I can't use that.

Hmm, maybe "Cvić" is not suitable. Let's think of another.

7. "Sic" – meaning "so." S, I, C. All V. 100%.

8. "Ćiz" – meaning "sow" or "she." Ć, I, Z. All V. 100%.

9. "Zić" – meaning "sow" or "she." Z, I, Ć. All V. 100%.

10. "Cić" – meaning "sow." C, I, Ć. All V. 100%.

Wait, but some of these might be the same words. Let me check if I have 10 unique words.

1. Ćić
2. Cizi
3. Sić
4. Zic
5. Cic
6. Sic
7. Ćiz
8. Zić
9. Ćić (again)
10. Cić

Hmm, I might be repeating some words. Maybe I need to find more unique ones.

Alternatively, I can think of longer words. Let's try 5 letters.

11. "Cicic" – but that's not a real word. Maybe "Cicica" – but that's a name, not a standard word.

Wait, maybe "Cic" is a real word, but I'm not sure. Let me think of other possibilities.

Perhaps "Zicic" – but again, not sure if it's a real word.

Alternatively, maybe "Cvijeć" – but that has V, which is not allowed.

Wait, perhaps "Ćićić" – but that's a longer version of "Ćić," which is a real word.

So, maybe:

10. Ćićić

But I'm not sure if that's commonly used. It might be a dialect form.

Alternatively, maybe "Cicin" – but that has N, which is not in V. So that's not allowed.

Hmm, this
