Okay, so I need to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 80% of its phonemes from the "Visoki (V)" class. The V class includes the phonemes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. 

First, I should understand what 80% means. If a word has, say, 5 letters, 80% would be 4 letters. So each word needs to have at least 4 out of 5 letters from the V class. But maybe the words can be longer as well. 

Let me think about the V class phonemes: /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. These correspond to letters like 'ć', 'i', 'c', 'z','s'. So I need to create words that use these letters predominantly.

I should check if these letters can form valid Croatian words. For example, 'ić' is a valid suffix in some words, like 'brat' + 'ić' = 'bratić'. Similarly, 'ci' is common, like in 'ci' meaning 'go'. 

Let me start brainstorming some words:

1. 'ić' - This is a suffix, but maybe not a standalone word. Maybe 'ići'?
2. 'ci' - A common word meaning 'go'.
3. 'zic' - Not a standard word, maybe 'zica' meaning 'female cicada'.
4.'sć' - Doesn't make sense, maybe'sćep'?
5. 'ćic' - Maybe 'ćić' which is a term of endearment.
6. 'cica' - Meaning 'girl'.
7.'sica' - Maybe'sika' which is a type of fish.
8. 'zic' - Maybe 'zic', but not sure.
9.'sć' - Doesn't seem right.
10. 'ćic' - Maybe another variation.

Wait, some of these might not be correct. I need to make sure each word is a valid Croatian word. Let me think again.

Maybe 'ići' is a form, but perhaps 'ić' is more of a suffix. 'Ci' is definitely a word. 'Zica' is a word. 'Ćić' is a word. 'Cica' is a word. 'Sica' is a word. 'Zic' is not a standard word. 'Sć' is not a word. 'Ćic' is a word.

So maybe the words are: 'ići', 'ci', 'zica', 'ćić', 'cica','sica', 'zic','sć', 'ćic'. But some of these might not be valid or common. I should verify each one.

Alternatively, maybe using's' and 'z' more. Words like'sas' or 'zaz' might not be valid. 'C' and 'ć' can be used in words like 'ćetvrt' but that has other letters too.

Wait, the requirement is 80% of the phonemes from V. So if a word has 5 letters, 4 need to be V. So let's try to make 5-letter words.

For example, 'ićići' - but that's too long. Maybe 'ićić' which is 4 letters. 3 V letters? No, needs 80%, so 3.2 letters, so 4 letters would need at least 3 V letters.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Let me list some possible words:

1. 'ići' - 3 letters, all V except maybe the 'i' is V. So 100% V.
2. 'ci' - 2 letters, both V.
3. 'zica' - 4 letters: 'z' (V), 'i' (V), 'c' (V), 'a' (non-V). So 75%, which is below 80%. Not good.
4. 'ćić' - 4 letters: 'ć' (V), 'i' (V), 'ć' (V). So 3 out of 4, which is 75%. Also below.
5. 'cica' - 'c' (V), 'i' (V), 'c' (V), 'a' (non-V). Again 75%.
6.'sica' -'s' (V), 'i' (V), 'c' (V), 'a' (non-V). 75%.
7. 'zic' - 'z' (V), 'i' (V), 'c' (V). 100% V. But is 'zic' a word? I'm not
