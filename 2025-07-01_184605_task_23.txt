Alright, so I've got this query where the user wants me to generate 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 90% of its phonemes from the 'Srednji' (S) class. The S class includes /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/. 

First, I need to make sure I understand the phoneme classes correctly. The user provided a list, so I should double-check that I'm using the right phonemes for each class. For Srednji, it's /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/.

Next, I need to figure out how to construct words where at least 90% of the phonemes are from S. Since each word should have minimal 90%, that means in a word, 90% or more of its phonemes should be from S. For example, if a word has 10 phonemes, at least 9 should be from S. If it's shorter, say 3 phonemes, at least 3 or 2.7, so 3 phonemes must be from S.

I should start by thinking of common Croatian words that use these phonemes. Maybe start with common endings or roots. For example, 'kada' has 'k', 'a', 'd', 'a' – all from S. That's a good candidate.

Another word could be 'brad', which has 'b' (N class), but wait, that's not from S. So I need to avoid that. Maybe 'rad' – 'r', 'a', 'd' – all S. That's better.

I should also consider longer words. For example,'skakati' –'s' is V class, so that's not good. Maybe'Krakata' – 'k', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'a', 't' – 't' is SV, so that's only one non-S phoneme. Wait, 't' is in SV, so that's acceptable as long as the majority is S.

Wait, the user said 90% or more, so in 'krakata', 't' is 1 out of 6 phonemes, which is about 16.6%, so that's way below 10%, so it's acceptable. But wait, no, because 1 out of 6 is about 16.6%, which is more than 10%, so it's not acceptable. So I need to make sure that only up to 10% are non-S.

So 'krakata' would have one non-S phoneme out of six, which is 16.6%, which is more than 10%, so it's not acceptable. So I need to find words where only up to 10% of the phonemes are non-S.

Maybe 'praska' – 'p' is N, 'r' is S, 'a' is S,'s' is V, 'k' is S. So 'p' and's' are non-S, which is 2 out of 5, 40%, which is way over. So that's not good.

Hmm, maybe 'radži' – 'r', 'a', 'dž', 'i' – 'i' is V, so that's one non-S out of four, which is 25%, still too high.

Wait, maybe 'bradža' – 'b' is N, 'r' is S, 'a' is S, 'dž' is S, 'a' is S. So 'b' is N, which is one out of five, 20%, still over 10%.

This is tricky. Maybe I should focus on words with all S phonemes. For example, 'radar' – 'r', 'a', 'd', 'a', 'r' – all S. That's 100%, so that's perfect.

Another one could be 'karakter' – 'k', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'k', 't', 'e', 'r' – 't' and 'e' are non-S. So that's 2 out of 8, 25%, which is too high.

Wait, 'karada' – 'k', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'd' – all S. That's five phonemes, all S. Perfect.

Maybe 'dakar' – 'd', 'a', 'k', 'a', 'r' – all S. Five phonemes, all S.

Another idea: 'krada' – 'k', 'r', 'a', 'd', 'a' – all S.

Wait
