Klase fonema u hrvatskom jeziku su:
Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

Napiši 10 riječi takvih da svaka riječ sadrži minimalno 50% fonema koji pripadaju klasi Srednjevisoki(SV), a preostali fonemi mogu biti iz drugih klasa fonema.

Okay, so I have this task where I need to generate 10 Croatian words, each containing at least 50% of their phonemes from the Srednjevisoki (SV) class. Let me first make sure I understand the classes correctly.

From the user's message, the phoneme classes are:

- Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
- Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
- Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
- Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
- Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

So, the SV class includes /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/. Each word needs to have at least half of its phonemes from this SV class.

I need to think of words where a majority of their sounds are from SV. Let me start by recalling some common words and their phoneme breakdowns.

For example, "čest" would break down into /č/, /e/, /št/. Wait, /št/ is a digraph, but in phonemes, it's /š/ and /t/. So that's three phonemes, all from SV: /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/. Wait, that's four phonemes, all SV. So "čest" would be 100% SV.

But I need to make sure each word is at least 50% SV. So maybe some words have a mix. Let me try to list some.

1. "čest" - /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/ → all SV.
2. "šet" - /š/, /e/, /t/ → all SV.
3. "tjest" - /t/, /j/, /e/, /š/, /t/ → all SV except maybe /j/ if it's considered SV. Yes, /j/ is SV.
4. "đečko" - /đ/, /e/, /č/, /k/, /o/ → /k/ is S, /o/ is SN. So SV phonemes are /đ/, /e/, /č/ → 3 out of 5, which is 60%. Good.
5. "češ" - /č/, /e/, /š/ → all SV.
6. "teš" - /t/, /e/, /š/ → all SV.
7. "jaš" - /j/, /a/, /š/ → /a/ is S, so SV is /j/, /š/ → 2 out of 3, which is 66%. Good.
8. "čev" - /č/, /e/, /v/ → /v/ is SN. So SV is /č/, /e/ → 2 out of 3, 66%. Okay.
9. "šet" - same as 2, but maybe another word. "šet" again, but perhaps "šeta" → /š/, /e/, /t/, /a/ → SV: /š/, /e/, /t/ → 3 out of 4, 75%. Good.
10. "čud" - /č/, /u/, /d/ → /u/ is N, /d/ is S. So SV is /č/ → 1 out of 3, which is 33%. That's below 50%, so I can't use this. Maybe another word. "čed" → /č/, /e/, /d/ → SV: /č/, /e/ → 2 out of 3, 66%. Good.

Wait, but I need 10 words. Let me check if I have enough. Maybe I can think of more.

Another example: "tež" - /t/, /e/, /ž/ → /ž/ is S. So SV is /t/, /e/ → 2 out of 3, 66%. Good.

Or "čet" - /č/, /e/, /t/ → all SV.

"češ" is already listed. Maybe "češa" → /č/, /e/, /š/, /a/ → SV: /č/, /e/, /š/ → 3 out of 4, 75%.

"jaš" is already there. Maybe "jašte" → /j/, /a/, /š/, /t/, /e/ → SV: /j/, /š/, /t/, /e/ → 4 out of 5, 80%.

"teš" is already there. Maybe "tešta" → /t/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /a/ → SV: /t/, /e/, /š/, /t/ → 4 out of 5, 80%.

I think I can compile a list of 10 now, making sure each has at least 50% SV phonemes.
</think>

Here is a list of 10 Croatian words, each containing at least 50% of their phonemes from the Srednjevisoki (SV) class:

1. **čest** - /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/  
   SV: 4/4 (100%)

2. **šet** - /š/, /e/, /t/  
   SV: 3/3 (100%)

3. **tjest** - /t/, /j/, /e/, /š/, /t/  
   SV: 5/5 (100%)

4. **đečko** - /đ/, /e/, /č/, /k/, /o/  
   SV: 3/5 (60%)

5. **češ** - /č/, /e/, /š/  
   SV: 3/3 (100%)

6. **teš** - /t/, /e/, /š/  
   SV: 3/3 (100%)

7. **jaš** - /j/, /a/, /š/  
   SV: 2/3 (66%)

8. **čev** - /č/, /e/, /v/  
   SV: 2/3 (66%)

9. **šeta** - /š/, /e/, /t/, /a/  
   SV: 3/4 (75%)

10. **tež** - /t/, /e/, /ž/  
    SV: 2/3 (66%)

Each word has been carefully selected to ensure that at least 50% of its phonemes belong to the SV class.
