Ti si asistent specijaliziran za lingvistiku i fonetiku hrvatskog jezika. Tvoj zadatak je generirati riječi prema specifičnim fonetskim zahtjevima i provjeriti njihovu valjanost. Koristi svoje znanje o hrvatskom standardnom jeziku i fonemima da bi stvorio odgovarajuće riječi. 

Klase fonema u hrvatskom jeziku su:
Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

Napiši 10 riječi takvih da svaka riječ sadrži minimalno 80% fonema koji pripadaju klasi Srednjevisoki(SV), a preostali fonemi mogu biti iz drugih klasa fonema.

Okay, so the user has given me a query where they want to generate 10 Croatian words that meet specific phonetic criteria. Each word needs to have at least 80% of its phonemes from the Srednjevisoki (SV) class. I remember that the SV class includes /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/.

First, I need to understand what 80% means. If a word has, say, 5 phonemes, 4 of them should be from SV. So, I have to ensure that in each word, the majority of the phonemes are from SV. The remaining can be from other classes but shouldn't exceed 20%.

I'll start by brainstorming words that have multiple SV phonemes. Maybe words with 'č', 'š', 't', etc. Let me think of some common Croatian words.

"Čest" comes to mind. Let's break it down: /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/. That's four SV phonemes. Wait, no, "čest" is actually /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/—four letters, all SV. So that's 100%, which definitely meets the 80% requirement.

Next, "šteta". That's /št/, /e/, /t/, /a/. Wait, /št/ is a single phoneme in Croatian, right? So that's one SV phoneme, /e/ is SV, /t/ is SV, and /a/ is S. So three out of four, which is 75%. Hmm, that's below 80%. Maybe I need to adjust this word or find another one.

Let me try "četvrt". /č/, /e/, /t/, /v/, /r/, /t/. So /č/, /e/, /t/, /t/ are SV, and /v/ and /r/ are not. That's four SV out of six, which is about 66.6%. Not enough. Maybe I need a shorter word or one with more SV phonemes.

How about "štamp"? /št/, /a/, /m/, /p/. That's one SV phoneme, which is too low. Not good. Maybe "često". /č/, /e/, /s/, /t/, /o/. Here, /č/, /e/, /t/ are SV, and /s/ and /o/ are not. So three out of five, which is 60%. Still not enough.

Wait, maybe "štapi". /št/, /a/, /p/, /i/. Only /št/ is SV, the rest are not. That's 25%. No good. I need words where most letters are SV.

Perhaps "četka". /č/, /e/, /t/, /k/, /a/. That's three SV phonemes out of five, which is 60%. Still not enough.

I'm struggling to find words that meet the 80% threshold. Maybe the user's requirement is too strict, or perhaps I'm not thinking of the right words. Alternatively, maybe the user expects me to create new words that fit the criteria, not necessarily existing ones.

Wait, the user specified "generirati riječi", which means generating words, not necessarily existing ones. So I can create new words as long as they follow the phonetic rules of Croatian.

Okay, let's try that. I'll create words with as many SV phonemes as possible. Let's see:

1. "Češt" – /č/, /e/, /št/. All SV. 100%.

2. "Šteć" – /š/, /t/, /e/, /ć/. /š/, /t/, /e/ are SV; /ć/ is V. So 75%. Close, but not 80%.

3. "Čevte" – /č/, /e/, /v/, /t/, /e/. /č/, /e/, /t/, /e/ are SV; /v/ is SN. So 80%. That works.

4. "Šted" – /š/, /t/, /e/, /d/. /š/, /t/, /e/ are SV; /d/ is S. So 75%.

5. "Češt" – same as the first one.

Wait, maybe I'm repeating words. Let me think of more.

6. "Štešt" – /š/, /t/, /e/, /št/. All SV. 100%.

7. "Čet" – /č/, /e/, /t/. All SV. 100%.

8. "Šteć" – /š/, /t/, /e/, /
