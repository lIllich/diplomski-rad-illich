Okay, so I have to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 50% of its phonemes from the "Srednji" (S) class. Let me first make sure I understand the classes correctly.

The phoneme classes are:
- Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
- Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
- Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
- Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
- Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

So, for each word, I need to count the phonemes and ensure that at least half of them are from the S class.

Let me start by thinking of some common words and breaking them down into their phonemes.

1. "Karakter" – Let's see. K is /k/, which is S. A is /a/, S. R is /r/, S. A again, S. K, S. T, which is SV. E, SV. R, S. So the breakdown is K(1), A(2), R(3), A(4), K(5), T(6), E(7), R(8). Out of 8 phonemes, 6 are S and 2 are SV. That's 75%, which is good.

2. "Drakar" – D(1), R(2), A(3), K(4), A(5), R(6). All S except maybe the last R? Wait, no, R is S. So all 6 phonemes are S. That's 100%, perfect.

3. "Krad" – K(1), R(2), A(3), D(4). All S. 100%.

4. "Krst" – K(1), R(2), S(3), T(4). Wait, S is Visoki, so that's V. So K, R, S, T. S is V, T is SV. So out of 4, K and R are S, S is V, T is SV. So only 50% S. Maybe that's acceptable, but the user wants at least 50%. Alternatively, maybe I can find a better word.

Wait, "Krst" has 4 phonemes: K, R, S, T. K and R are S, so 2 out of 4, which is 50%. So that's acceptable.

5. "Rad" – R(1), A(2), D(3). All S. 100%.

6. "Kakav" – K(1), A(2), K(3), A(4), V(5). V is SN. So K, A, K, A, V. K and A are S, so 4 out of 5, which is 80%. Good.

7. "Kuk" – K(1), U(2), K(3). U is N. So K, U, K. Only Ks are S, so 2 out of 3, which is ~66%. Acceptable.

8. "Kakav" – Wait, I already did that. Maybe "Kakav" again, but perhaps I need a different word. Alternatively, "Kakar" – K, A, K, A, R. All S except R? No, R is S. So all S. 100%.

9. "Kakar" – As above.

10. "Kakav" – Again, but maybe I need to find another word.

Wait, maybe "Kakav" is repeated. Let me think of another word.

"Kakav" is 5 letters, but maybe "Kakar" is better. Alternatively, "Kakar" is 5 letters as well.

Alternatively, "Kakav" is more common.

Alternatively, maybe "Kakav" is acceptable as it's 80% S.

Wait, but the user wants 10 words, so I need to make sure I have 10 unique words.

Let me think of more words.

"Kakar" – as above.

"Kakav" – as above.

"Kakav" again, but maybe I need to find another.

Alternatively, "Kakav" is one, "Kakar" is another.

Alternatively, "Kakav" and "Kakar
