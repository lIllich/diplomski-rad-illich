Okay, so I need to create a sentence in Croatian that's at least 100 characters long, and at least 70% of the phonemes should be from the 'Niski' (Low) class. The Low class includes /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/. The remaining 30% can be from other classes, but I have to make sure the sentence makes sense and uses valid Croatian words.

First, I should figure out what 70% of 100 characters is. That's 70 characters. So, at least 70 characters need to be from the Low class phonemes. The rest can be from other classes.

I need to think of words that have a lot of these Low class sounds. Maybe words with'm', 'n', 'b', 'p', 'u'. Let's start by brainstorming some words.

Words with'm': mama, mali, mrtvi, mjesto, mjesto, mjesto...
Words with 'n': nana, nano, noga, nit, nježna...
Words with 'b': baba, bob, brat, bok, buba...
Words with 'p': papa, pjesma, pobjeda, palačinke...
Words with 'u': uži, uši, uho, uvo, učenik...

I can try to create a sentence using these words. Maybe something like "Mama je mala i mrtva, nježna je nana, baba i papa su bili uži." But that's probably not enough. Let me count the characters.

Wait, maybe I should structure it more methodically. Let's plan the sentence to include as many Low class phonemes as possible.

Start with "Mama je mala i mrtva." That's 16 characters. Let's see: M, a, m, a, j, e, m, a, l, a, i, m, r, t, v, a. Phonemes: /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /j/, /e/, /m/, /a/, /l/, /a/, /i/, /m/, /r/, /t/, /v/, /a/. So Low class: /m/, /m/, /m/, /l/, /m/, /r/, /v/. That's 7 Low phonemes in 16 characters, which is about 43.75%. Not enough.

I need to increase the percentage. Maybe use more words with'm', 'n', 'b', 'p', 'u'.

How about "Mama je mala, nježna je nana, baba i papa su uži." Let's count the characters: 30 characters. Phonemes: /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /j/, /e/, /m/, /a/, /l/, /a/, /n/, /j/, /e/, /ž/, /n/, /a/, /n/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /i/, /p/, /a/, /p/, /a/, /s/, /u/, /ž/, /i/. Now, Low class: /m/, /m/, /m/, /l/, /n/, /n/, /n/, /b/, /b/, /p/, /p/, /u/. That's 12 Low phonemes in 30 characters, which is 40%. Still not enough.

I need to get to 70%. Maybe use longer words or more repetition of Low class sounds.

Let's try: "Mama mješa mrambe, nježna je nana, baba i papa su uži." Let's count: 33 characters. Phonemes: /m/, /a/, /m/, /j/, /e/, /š/, /a/, /m/, /r/, /a/, /m/, /b/, /e/, /n/, /j/, /e/, /ž/, /n/, /a/, /n/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /i/, /p/, /a/, /p/, /a/, /s/, /u/, /ž/, /i/. Low class: /m/, /m/, /m/, /r/, /m/, /b/, /n/, /n/, /b/, /b/, /p/, /p/, /u/. That's 13 Low phonemes in 33 characters, about 39.4%. Still not enough.

Hmm, maybe I need to use more 'n' and'm' sounds. Let's try a sentence with "mama" repeated and "nana" as well.

"Mama je mama, nana je nana, baba i papa su uži." Let's count: 30 characters. Phonemes: /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /j/, /e/, /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /n/, /a/, /n/, /a/, /j/, /e/, /n/, /a/, /n/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /b/, /a/, /i/, /p/, /a/, /p/, /a/, /s/, /u/, /ž/, /i/. Low class: /m/, /m/, /m/, /m/, /n/, /n/, /n/, /n/, /b/, /b/, /p/, /p/, /u/. That's 13 Low phonemes in 30 characters, about 43.3%. Still not 70%.

Wait, maybe I'm misunderstanding. The 70% applies to the phonemes, not the characters. So if the sentence is 100 characters, and each character is a phoneme, then 70 phonemes need to be Low class. But in reality, each character isn't a phoneme. So perhaps I need to calculate based on the number of phonemes, not characters.

Wait, the user said "minimalno 100 znakova" which is 100 characters, and "minimalno 70% fonema koji pripadaju klasi Niski (N)". So 70% of the phonemes in the sentence should be Low class.

So if the sentence has X phonemes, 0.7X should be Low class.

But the sentence is 100 characters long, so I need to make sure that when I count all the phonemes in the sentence, 70% of them are from the Low class.

This is a bit more complex because each character can represent one or more phonemes. For example, 'č' is one character but represents one phoneme. 'nj' is two characters but represents one phoneme.

So I need to count the total number of phonemes in the sentence and ensure that 70% of them are from the Low class.

This complicates things because I have to count each phoneme, not just the characters.

Let me try to construct a sentence where as many phonemes as possible are from the Low class.

Let's start with "Mama je mala i mrtva." Phonemes: /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /j/, /e/, /m/, /a/, /l/, /a/, /i/, /m/, /r/, /t/, /v/, /a/. Total phonemes: 16. Low class: /m/, /m/, /m/, /l/, /m/, /r/, /v/. That's 7 out of 16, which is about 43.75%.

Not enough. I need 70%.

Maybe I can use a sentence with more Low class phonemes. Let's try "Mama mješa mrambe, nježna je nana, baba i papa su uži." Let's break it down:

"Mama mješa mrambe, nježna je nana, baba i papa su uži."

Phonemes:

Mama: /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/
mješa: /m/, /j/, /e/, /š/, /a/
mrambe: /m/, /r/, /a/, /m/, /b/, /e/
nježna: /n/, /j/, /e/, /ž/, /n/, /a/
je: /j/, /e/
nana: /n/, /a/, /n/, /a/
baba: /b/, /a/, /b/, /a/
i: /i/
papa: /p/, /a/, /p/, /a/
su: /s/, /u/
uži: /u/, /ž/, /i/

Now, count all the phonemes:

Mama: 4
mješa: 5
mrambe: 6
nježna: 6
je: 2
nana: 4
baba: 4
i: 1
papa: 4
su: 2
uži: 3

Total phonemes: 4+5+6+6+2+4+4+1+4+2+3 = 41

Low class phonemes: /m/, /m/,
