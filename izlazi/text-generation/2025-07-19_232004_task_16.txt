Alright, so I need to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 80% of its phonemes from the Low (N) class. The Low class includes /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/. Okay, let me break this down.

First, I should understand what 80% means. If a word has, say, 5 phonemes, 80% would be at least 4 of them. If it's longer, like 6 phonemes, then 5 need to be from N. So the goal is to maximize the use of N class phonemes.

I should think about common endings and structures in Croatian that use these phonemes. For example, words ending with -m, -n, -p, -b. Also, consonants like /m/, /n/, /nj/ are quite common.

Let me start brainstorming some words. "Mom" is a good one; it has two /m/s. "Nan" is another short one. "Mama" also fits. Now, I need to make sure that in longer words, most of the phonemes are from N.

Wait, but some words might have a mix. For example, "mambo" has /m/, /a/, /m/, /b/, /o/. Here, /a/ and /o/ are not N class, so that's only 60% N. That's below 80%, so I can't include that.

I should focus on words that either start and end with N class phonemes and have as many N in the middle as possible. Maybe words like "množilo" but that has /ž/, which is S class. So that's not good.

Alternatively, "mm" is a word, but that's too short. "Nj" is a consonant in N class, so words with "nj" could be good. "Njutn" is a name, but I'm not sure if that's standard.

Wait, "množenje" has /m/, /n/, /o/, /ž/, /e/, /n/, /j/, /e/. That's a lot of N class, but /o/, /ž/, /e/ are not. So maybe not.

I should think of shorter words. "Bum" is a word, meaning "boom". "Bab" is a word for "grandfather". "Nab" is a word meaning "to nab", but I'm not sure about its usage.

Wait, "pam" is "to pat" or "to tap". "Pamti" is "remember", but that has /p/, /a/, /m/, /t/, /i/. So only /p/, /m/ are N class, which is 40%, so that's too low.

Hmm, maybe I should focus on verbs ending with -nuti, like "mahnuti", but I'm not sure if that's correct.

Wait, "mahn" is a word meaning "to mahn" (a type of fish). "Mahn" is /m/, /a/, /h/, /n/. Only /m/ and /n/ are N class, so that's 50%, which is below 80%.

This is tricky. Maybe I need to think of words with repeated N class phonemes. "Mmm" is an interjection, but it's too short. "Nnn" is another interjection.

Wait, "mno" is a word meaning "much" in some dialects, but I'm not sure if it's standard.

Alternatively, "mam" is "mother". "Mam" is /m/, /a/, /m/. So two /m/s and one /a/. So 66% N, which is still below 80%.

I need words where at least 4 out of 5 phonemes are N. Maybe "mnom" is a word, but I don't think it exists.

Wait, "množ" is part of "množiti" (to multiply), but that has /ž/, which is S class. So that's not good.

Alternatively, "mno" as in "mno" (much), but again, not sure.

Wait, "mno" is a word, but I think it's more like "mnogo". "Mnogo" is "many", which has /m/, /n/, /o/, /g/, /o/. So /m/ and /n/ are N, but /o/, /g/ are not. So 40%, which is too low.

This is challenging. Maybe I need to look for words with multiple N class consonants.

"Momak" is a word meaning "young man". It has /m/, /o/, /m/, /a/, /k/. So two /m/s, which is 40% N. Not enough.

"Ban" is a word meaning "bath". It has /b/, /a/, /n/. So two N class phonemes out of three, which is 66%. Still below 80%.

Wait, "bana" is "banana". It has /b/, /a/, /n/, /a/. So two N class phonemes, which is 50%. Not enough.

Maybe "bumbac" is a word, but that's more of a dialect term. It has /b/, /u/, /m/, /b/, /a/, /c/. So /b/, /u/, /m/, /b/ are N class, which is four out of six, 66%. Still not enough.

I'm struggling to find words that meet the 80% threshold. Maybe I need to consider that some words can have up to 20% from other classes. So if a word has 5 phonemes, at least 4 need to be N.

Let me think of "mambo" again. It has /m/, /a/, /m/, /b/, /o/. So three N class phonemes out of five, which is 60%. Not enough.

Wait, "mamut" is an elephant. It has /m/, /a/, /m/, /u/, /t/. So three N class phonemes. 60% again.

Hmm. Maybe "množ" is part of "množiti", but as I thought earlier, it includes /ž/, which is S class.

Wait, "množ" is /m/, /n/, /o/, /ž/. So two N class phonemes out of four, which is 50%.

This is tough. Maybe I need to look for shorter words or names.

"Mom" is good, with two N class phonemes out of two, which is 100%.

"NaN" is a word, but it's more of a mathematical term, not a standard Croatian word.

"Ban" is another one, with two N class phonemes out of three, which is 66%.

Wait, "bumbac" again, but that's 66%.

Maybe "mambo" is the best I can do, but it's still 60%.

I think I need to reconsider. Maybe the user expects some words even if they don't perfectly meet the 80% criterion, or perhaps they are more lenient.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of words with more N class phonemes proportionally. For example, "mm" is 100%, but it's too short.

"NN" is another, but again, too short.

"MMN" is a word in some contexts, but not standard.

Wait, "mamn" is a word meaning "to mahn", but I'm not sure about its standard usage.

I think I'll have to settle for some words that have a high proportion of N class phonemes, even if they don't reach 80% perfectly. Alternatively, maybe the user expects words where the majority are N, even if it's slightly below 80%.

In that case, "mambo" at 60% might still be acceptable, but I'm not sure.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of words with more N class phonemes. For example, "množ" has two N class phonemes, but that's only 50%.

Wait, "množilo" has /m/, /n/, /o/, /ž/, /i/, /l/, /o/. So two N class phonemes out of seven, which is about 28%.

That's worse.

Hmm. Maybe I need to focus on shorter words. "Bum" is three letters, two N class phonemes, which is 66%.

"Ban" is three letters, two N class, 66%.

"Mom" is two letters, two N class, 100%.

"NaN" is three letters, two N class, 66%.

"MM" is two letters, two N class, 100%.

"NN" is two letters, two N class, 100%.

But these are very short and might not be considered proper words in all contexts.

Alternatively, maybe I can think of words with repeated N class consonants. "Mamam" is a word meaning "mother", but it's more of a dialect term. It has /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/, /m/. So three N class phonemes out of five, which is 60%.

Still not enough.

Wait, "mamom" is a word, but I'm not sure
