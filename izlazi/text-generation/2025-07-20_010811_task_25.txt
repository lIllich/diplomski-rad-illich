Okay, so I've got this query where the user wants me to generate 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 90% of its phonemes from the 'Visoki (V)' class. The V class includes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. 

First, I need to understand what 90% means. Since it's minimal, I can have some phonemes from other classes, but most must be from V. For example, a 5-letter word can have at most one non-V phoneme. 

I should think of common suffixes or endings that use V phonemes. Maybe -ić, -čić, -šić, -zec, etc. These endings are common and fit the V class.

Let me brainstorm some words. Maybe start with shorter words and build up. 

1. "Ćelik" – Ć is V, e is SV, l is SN, i is V, k is S. Wait, that's only two V phonemes out of five. That's 40%, which is too low. I need to adjust.

Hmm, maybe "Ćili" – Ć, i, l, i. Wait, l is SN, so only three V phonemes (Ć, i, i) out of four. That's 75%, still below 90%. Not good enough.

What about "Zvižd"? Z is V, v is SN, ž is S, d is S. Only one V phoneme. Not good.

Wait, maybe "Ćučić" – Ć, u is N, č is SV, i, c. So Ć and c are V, but u and č are not. Only two V out of five. No good.

I need to find words where most letters are from V. Maybe "Ivić" – I is V, v is SN, i is V, Ć is V. So three V out of four. That's 75% again. Still not enough.

Wait, maybe "Sic" – S is V, i is V, c is V. All three are V. Perfect. But it's only three letters, so 100%.

Another one: "Zvijezda" – Z is V, v is SN, i is V, j is SV, e is SV, z is V, d is S, a is S. Only three V out of eight. Not enough.

Maybe "Ćizma" – Ć is V, i is V, z is V, m is N. So three V out of four. 75%. Still not 90%.

Wait, maybe "Izvan" – I is V, z is V, v is SN, a is S, n is N. Only two V out of five. Not enough.

Hmm, perhaps I'm approaching this wrong. Maybe I should look for words that are made up mostly of V phonemes, even if they're longer. For example, "Cviće" – C is V, v is SN, i is V, Ć is V, e is SV. So three V out of five. 60%. Not enough.

Wait, "Svižek" – S is V, v is SN, i is V, ž is S, e is SV, k is S. Only two V out of six. No good.

Maybe "Zvono" – Z is V, v is SN, o is SN, n is N, o is SN. Only one V. No.

This is tricky. Maybe I should focus on shorter words where more letters are V. For example, "Ic" – I is V, c is V. That's two letters, 100%. But it's a short word. Maybe "Ic" is too short, but it fits.

Another idea: "Cvić" – C is V, v is SN, i is V, Ć is V. So three V out of four. 75%. Still not enough.

Wait, "Ćuća" – Ć is V, u is N, Ć is V, a is S. Only two V out of four. 50%. No.

Maybe "Svima" – S is V, v is SN, i is V, m is N, a is S. Two V out of five. 40%.

This is harder than I thought. Maybe I should look for words where the majority of letters are V, even if they're not all. Let's try "Zvižd" again – Z is V, v is SN, ž is S, d is S. Only one V. Not good.

Wait, "Ivić" – I is V, v is SN, i is V, Ć is V. So three V out of four. 75%. Still below 90%.

Maybe "Ćelić" – Ć is V, e is SV, l is SN, i is V, Ć is V. So three V out of five. 60%.

Hmm, perhaps I'm not finding enough words. Maybe I should think of names or less common words. For example, "Ivančić" – I is V, v is SN, a is S, n is N, Č is SV, i is V, Ć is V. That's three V out of seven. 43%. No.

Wait, "Zvono" – Z is V, v is SN, o is SN, n is N, o is SN. Only one V.

Maybe "Cviž" – C is V, v is SN, i is V, ž is S. Two V out of four. 50%.

I'm struggling to find words where at least 90% of the phonemes are V. Maybe I should consider that 90% is a high bar, so the words might be short or have repeating V phonemes.

Let me try "Ic" again – two letters, both V. That's 100%. Good.

Another one: "Ćik" – Ć is V, i is V, k is S. Two V out of three. 66%. Not enough.

Wait, "Zic" – Z is V, i is V, c is V. Three letters, all V. 100%. Perfect.

Another idea: "Cvi" – C is V, v is SN, i is V. Two V out of three. 66%. Not enough.

Hmm, maybe "Izvi" – I is V, z is V, v is SN, i is V. Three V out of four. 75%. Still not 90%.

Wait, "Svij" – S is V, v is SN, i is V, j is SV. Two V out of four. 50%.

This is challenging. Maybe I should look for words with multiple V phonemes and few others. For example, "Izvan" – I is V, z is V, v is SN, a is S, n is N. Two V out of five. 40%.

Wait, "Zvižd" – Z is V, v is SN, ž is S, d is S. Only one V.

I'm not finding enough words that meet the 90% threshold. Maybe the user's request is too strict, and it's hard to find such words. Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing some words that fit better.

Wait, let me think of "Ćuća" again – Ć is V, u is N, Ć is V, a is S. Two V out of four. 50%.

Maybe "Ivić" – I is V, v is SN, i is V, Ć is V. Three V out of four. 75%.

I think I'm stuck. Perhaps the user needs to adjust the requirements, or I might have to include some words that are close but don't meet the exact 90%.
