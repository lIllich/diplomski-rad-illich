Okay, so I need to create 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 60% of its phonemes from the 'Srednji' (S) class. The S class includes /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/. 

First, I should understand what 60% means. If a word has 4 phonemes, at least 3 should be from S. If it's 5 phonemes, at least 3. If it's 6, at least 4. So, I need to make sure that in each word, the majority are from S.

I'll start by thinking of common endings or parts of words that use S phonemes. For example, 'ak' is a common ending, and both 'a' and 'k' are in S. 'r' is also in S, so words with 'r' could be good. 'd' is another S phoneme, so maybe words ending with 'd'.

I should also consider the structure of Croatian words. They often have consonant clusters, so combining S phonemes with others might be possible as long as the majority are S.

Let me think of some possible words:

1. 'kratki' - k, r, a, t, k, i. Wait, 't' is SV and 'i' is V. So only 3 out of 5 are S. That's 60%, so it's acceptable. But maybe I can find a better one.

2. 'državni' - d, r, ž, a, v, n, i. 'd', 'r', 'a' are S, 'ž' is S, 'v' is SN, 'n' is N, 'i' is V. So 4 S out of 7, which is about 57%. Not enough.

3. 'brzo' - b, r, z, o. 'b' is N, 'r' is S, 'z' is V, 'o' is SN. Only 1 S out of 4. Not good.

4. 'prst' - p, r, s, t. 'p' is N, 'r' is S,'s' is V, 't' is SV. Only 1 S. Not good.

5. 'kraj' - k, r, a, j. 'k', 'r', 'a' are S, 'j' is SV. So 3 out of 4, which is 75%. Good.

6. 'drugo' - d, r, u, g, o. 'd', 'r' are S, 'u' is N, 'g' is SN, 'o' is SN. Only 2 S out of 5. Not enough.

7.'skakati' - s, k, a, k, a, t, i.'s' is V, 'k', 'a' are S, 't' is SV, 'i' is V. So 3 S out of 7. Not enough.

8. 'rad' - r, a, d. All S. 100%. Good.

9. 'krožni' - k, r, o, ž, n, i. 'k', 'r', 'ž' are S, 'o' is SN, 'n' is N, 'i' is V. So 3 S out of 6, which is 50%. Not enough.

10.'skora' - s, k, o, r, a.'s' is V, 'k', 'r', 'a' are S. So 3 S out of 5, which is 60%. Acceptable.

Hmm, I need 10 words, and some of these might not meet the criteria. Maybe I should look for words with more S phonemes.

Another approach: Start with S phonemes and build words around them.

1. 'kraji' - k, r, a, j, i. 'k', 'r', 'a' are S, 'j' is SV, 'i' is V. So 3 out of 5, which is 60%. Okay.

2. 'državna' - d, r, ž, a, v, n, a. 'd', 'r', 'ž', 'a' are S, 'v' is SN, 'n' is N. So 4 S out of 7, about 57%. Not enough.

3. 'brzo' - as before, not enough.

4.'skakati' - as before, not enough.

5. 'krožni' - as before, 50%.

6. 'radno' - r, a, d, n, o. 'r', 'a', 'd' are S, 'n' is N, 'o' is SN. 3 out of 5, 60%. Okay.

7.'skora' - as before, 60%.

8. 'kraj' - 75%.

9. 'drži' - d, r, ž, i. 'd', 'r', 'ž' are S, 'i' is V. 3 out of 4, 75%. Okay.

10. 'karakter' - k, a, r, a, k, t, e, r. 'k', 'a', 'r', 'a', 'k', 'r' are S, 't' is SV, 'e' is SV. So 6 S out of 8, 75%. Good.

Wait, but I need to make sure each word meets at least 60%. So I'll list them:

1. 'kraji' - 3/5=60%
2. 'radno' - 3/5=60%
3.'skora' - 3/5=60%
4. 'kraj' - 3/4=75%
5. 'drži' - 3/4=75%
6. 'karakter' - 6/8=75%
7. 'kratki' - 3/5=60% (earlier thought, but 't' is SV)
8. 'državni' - 4/7≈57% (doesn't meet)
9. 'prst' - 1/4=25% (doesn't meet)
10. 'brzo' - 1/4=25% (doesn't meet)

So I need to replace the ones that don't meet. Maybe 'karakter' is good, but it's longer. Maybe 'krožni' is 3/6=50%, not enough.

Alternatively,'skakati' is 3/7≈43%, not enough.

Maybe 'krožni' can be adjusted. 'krožni' is 3 S, maybe another word.

Alternatively,'skakati' is too short. Maybe'skakati' can be split into'skak' which is s, k, a, k.'s' is V, 'k', 'a' are S. So 2/4=50%. Not enough.

Alternatively,'skak' is 2/4=50%.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find more words.

Another idea: 'krožni' is 3 S, but if I add another S phoneme, maybe 'krožniš' but that's not a real word.

Alternatively, 'krožništvo' but that's too long and may not be real.

Alternatively, think of 'krožni' as 3 S, but maybe I can find another word.

Wait, 'krožni' is 3 S out of 6, which is 50%. So I need a word with at least 4 S out of 6, which is 66.6%.

Alternatively, 'krožni' is not enough. Maybe 'krožna' - same issue.

Alternatively, 'krožni' is a noun, maybe 'krožni' as an adjective, but still same phonemes.

Alternatively, 'krožni' is 3 S, so not enough.

Maybe 'krožni' is not suitable. Let me think of another word.

How about 'krožništvo'? No, too long and not real.

Alternatively, 'krožni' is the best I can do, but it's 50%.

Alternatively, think of a word with 4 S phonemes.

For example, 'krožni' is 3 S, but if I can find a 4-phoneme word with 3 S, that would be 75%.

Wait, 'krožni' is 6 letters, but phonemes are 6? Wait, 'krožni' is k, r, o, ž, n, i. So 6 phonemes, 3 S.

So 3/6=50%. Not enough.

I need to find words where the number of S phonemes is at least 60% of the total phonemes.

Let me think of a 5-phoneme word with 3 S.

For example, 'kratki' - k, r, a, t, k, i. Wait, that's 6 phonemes.
