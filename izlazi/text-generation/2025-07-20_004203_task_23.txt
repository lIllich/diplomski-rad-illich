Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/

Okay, so I have this task where I need to come up with 10 Croatian words that each contain at least 90% of their phonemes from the "Srednji" (Middle) class. Let me break this down.

First, I need to recall the classes of phonemes in Croatian. The user provided them, so I should review them:

- Niski (Low): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
- Srednjeniski (Mid-Low): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
- Srednji (Middle): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
- Srednjevisoki (Mid-High): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
- Visoki (High): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

So, the "Srednji" class includes /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/. That's seven phonemes.

Now, the task is to create words where at least 90% of their phonemes are from the Srednji class. Since each word must have at least 90% Srednji phonemes, and assuming an average word length, let's say each word has 5 phonemes. Then, 90% of 5 is 4.5, so at least 5 phonemes, meaning all phonemes should be from Srednji. Wait, but that might be too strict because the user says "minimalno 90%", so maybe 90% or more.

Wait, let me think again. If a word has, say, 5 phonemes, 90% is 4.5, so at least 5 would be 100%. But perhaps the user means that 90% of the phonemes are from Srednji, allowing up to 10% from other classes. So, for a 5-phoneme word, 4.5 would mean 4 from Srednji and 1 from another class.

But the user's example response had words with all phonemes from Srednji, so maybe they expect words where all or almost all phonemes are from Srednji.

I should also remember that in Croatian, some phonemes are digraphs, like /nj/, /lj/, /dž/, /č/, /ć/, etc. So, each of these counts as a single phoneme.

Let me think of some words. Maybe start with simple ones.

1. "kraj" – phonemes /k/, /r/, /a/, /j/. Wait, /j/ is in Srednjevisoki (SV). So that's one phoneme not in Srednji. So 3 out of 4 are Srednji. That's 75%, which is below 90%. So this word wouldn't qualify.

Wait, maybe I should look for words that consist mainly of Srednji phonemes.

Let me list the Srednji phonemes again: /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/.

So, possible consonants: /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/. Vowels: /a/.

Wait, that's only one vowel, /a/. So if I'm creating words, they can only have /a/ as the vowel, unless I include other vowels from other classes, but that would reduce the percentage.

Hmm, that complicates things because most Croatian words have other vowels like /e/, /i/, etc., which are not in Srednji.

Wait, but the Srednji class includes /a/ as the vowel. So, perhaps words with only /a/ as the vowel and consonants from Srednji.

Let me think of some words.

1. "kada" – /k/, /a/, /d/, /a/. All consonants are Srednji, vowels are /a/. So all phonemes are Srednji. That's 100%.

2. "rad" – /r/, /a/, /d/. All Srednji.

3. "dak" – /d/, /a/, /k/. All Srednji.

4. "krd" – Not a word. Maybe "kard" – /k/, /a/, /r/, /d/. All Srednji.

5. "dra" – /d/, /r/, /a/. All Srednji.

6. "akra" – /a/, /k/, /r/, /a/. All Srednji.

7. "radža" – /r/, /a/, /dž/, /a/. All Srednji.

8. "žak" – /ž/, /a/, /k/. All Srednji.

9. "afra" – /a/, /f/, /r/, /a/. All Srednji.

10. "frad" – /f/, /r/, /a/, /d/. All Srednji.

Wait, but some of these might not be real words. For example, "krd" isn't a word, but "kard" is a card, which is a loanword. Similarly, "radža" might not be a standard word.

I need to ensure that the words are valid Croatian words. Let me check some of them.

"akra" – I think that's a valid word, meaning "ankle" or part of the leg.

"žak" – That's a valid word, meaning "student" or "pupil".

"afra" – I'm not sure if that's a valid word. Maybe "afra" isn't standard. Perhaps "afrika" is a word, but that includes /f/ and /r/ and /i/, which is not Srednji.

Wait, "afrika" has /i/, which is Visoki, so that's not allowed.

So, maybe I need to find words that only have /a/ as the vowel and consonants from Srednji.

Let me think again.

1. "kada" – valid.

2. "rad" – valid.

3. "dak" – valid.

4. "kard" – valid, though it's a loanword.

5. "dra" – valid, though it's a bit informal.

6. "akra" – valid.

7. "radža" – not sure, but perhaps it's a dialect word.

8. "žak" – valid.

9. "afra" – not sure, maybe not valid.

10. "frad" – not a standard word.

Hmm, perhaps I need to find more valid words. Let me think of other possibilities.

"karada" – /k/, /a/, /r/, /a/, /d/. All Srednji. That's a valid word meaning "body".

"rador" – /r/, /a/, /d/, /o/, /r/. Wait, /o/ is Srednjeniski, so that's one phoneme not in Srednji. So that's 4 out of 5, which is 80%, below 90%.

So, "rador" wouldn't qualify.

"radak" – /r/, /a/, /d/, /a/, /k/. All Srednji. That's a valid word meaning "root".

"drak" – /d/, /r/, /a/, /k/. All Srednji. Valid word meaning "dragon".

"akra" – as before.

"žak" – as before.

"afra" – unsure.

"frad" – unsure.

So, perhaps I can compile a list of 10 words, making sure they're valid and consist mostly of Srednji phonemes.

Let me try:

1. "kada" – valid.

2. "rad" – valid.

3. "dak" – valid.

4. "kard" – valid.

5. "dra" – valid.

6. "akra" – valid.

7. "radža" – perhaps dialectal, but let's include it.

8. "žak" – valid.

9. "karada" – valid.

10. "drak" – valid.

I think that's 10 words. Each of these words has all phonemes from Srednji, except perhaps "radža" and "karada" if they have other phonemes, but I think they fit.

Wait, "karada" is /k/, /a/, /r/, /a/, /d/ – all Srednji.

"drak" is /d/, /r/, /a/, /k/ – all Srednji.

"radža" is /r/, /a/, /dž/, /a/ – all Srednji.

"žak" is /ž/, /a/, /k/ – all Srednji.

So, all 10 words meet the criteria of having 90% or more phonemes from Srednji.

Here is a list of 10 Croatian words, each containing at least 90% of their phonemes from the "Srednji" (Middle) class:
