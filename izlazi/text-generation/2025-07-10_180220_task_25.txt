Okay, so I need to create a sentence in Croatian that's at least 100 characters long and contains at least 90% of the phonemes from the High (V) class. The V class includes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. The remaining 10% can be from other classes. 

First, I should list out the V class phonemes to make sure I include as many as possible. The V class has /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. So, I need to use words that have these sounds. 

I should think of common Croatian words that have these phonemes. For example, "ići" has /i/ and /ć/, "čić" has /ć/, "čiz" has /ć/ and /z/, "čas" has /ć/, /a/, and /s/, but wait, /a/ is from the S class, so that's outside the V class. I need to be careful with that.

Maybe I can create a sentence using words that repeat V class phonemes. Let's see, "ićići" is a word meaning "go away" in plural, which has multiple /i/ and /ć/ sounds. "Čiz" is another word, but I'm not sure if it's commonly used. Maybe "čas" is better, but it includes /a/, which is not V. Hmm, maybe I should avoid words with non-V phonemes as much as possible.

I can also use "čić" which is a term of endearment, so that's /ć/. Maybe "čići" as well. Let me try to build a sentence. 

"Ćići, ići, čići, ići, čiz, čiz, čas, čas, čići, ići, čiz, čas." Wait, but "čas" includes /a/, which is S class. I need to minimize that. Maybe replace "čas" with another V word. Is there a word with /s/ that I can use? "S" is a V class phoneme. Maybe "s" as a standalone, but that's not a word. Or "čis" which means "clean" in imperative, but that's /č/, /i/, /s/. /č/ is SV class, so that's not good. Hmm.

Alternatively, maybe "ićići" repeated several times. Let's see: "Ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići, ićići." That's all /i/ and /ć/, which are V class. But that's very repetitive and might not make much sense. Maybe add a bit more variety.

Wait, "čiz" is a word, but I'm not sure about its meaning. Maybe "čiz" is a dialect word. Alternatively, "čić" is a term, so maybe use that. Let me try: "Ćići, ići, čići, ići, čiz, čiz, čići, ići, čiz, čići, ići, čiz." But again, I'm not sure if "čiz" is correct. Maybe I should stick to more common words.

Alternatively, maybe use "ići" multiple times. "Ići, ići, ići, ići, ići, ići, ići, ići, ići, ići." That's all /i/ and /ć/, which are V. But again, very repetitive. Maybe add a word with /s/ or /z/. For example, "z" is a V phoneme. Is there a word like "z" in Croatian? "Za" is a preposition, but that includes /a/, which is S. Maybe "zi" as in plural of "životinja" but that's more complex. 

Alternatively, "čas" is a word, but it includes /a/. Maybe it's acceptable as the 10% non-V. So, in the sentence, most of the phonemes are V, and a few are S or SV. Let me try constructing a sentence with "ićići", "ići", "čas", "čiz".

"Ićići, ići, čas, čiz, čas, čiz, ićići, ići, čas, čiz, ićići, ići, čas, čiz." That's 14 words, each contributing V phonemes, except "čas" which has /a/. So, out of 14 words, 12 are V, 2
