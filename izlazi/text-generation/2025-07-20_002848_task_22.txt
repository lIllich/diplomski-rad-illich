Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

Napiši 10 riječi takvih da svaka riječ sadrži minimalno 90% fonema koji pripadaju klasi Srednjeniski (SN), a preostali fonemi mogu biti iz drugih klasa fonema.

Alright, so the user has given me a query where they want 10 Croatian words that have at least 90% of their phonemes from the Srednjeniski (SN) class. The SN class includes /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/. 

First, I need to understand what 90% means in terms of the number of phonemes. If a word has, say, 4 phonemes, 90% would mean at least 4 phonemes from SN. But wait, 4 out of 4 is 100%, so maybe I need to adjust. Perhaps for words with more phonemes, like 5, 90% would be 4.5, so at least 5 SN phonemes. But that might be too strict. Maybe it's better to aim for as many SN phonemes as possible, with minimal from other classes.

Looking at the SN class, the vowels are /o/, and consonants are /v/, /g/, /h/, /l/, /lj/. So words that have a lot of these sounds would fit. For example, "volov" has /v/, /o/, /l/, which are all SN. "Golov" has /g/, /o/, /l/, which are all SN. 

I should think of common Croatian words that use these sounds. Maybe words related to body parts, like "glav", "ruka" (but "ruka" has /r/ which is S class, so that's not good). "Oboj" has /o/, /b/ (which is N class), so that's not ideal. 

Wait, "lj" is also in SN. So words like "ljubav" have /lj/, /u/ (N), /b/ (N), /a/ (S). That's only one SN phoneme, so that's not good. Maybe "lova" has /l/, /o/, /v/ – all SN. 

I need to make sure each word has as many SN phonemes as possible. Let me list some potential words:

1. "golov" – /g/, /o/, /l/, /v/ – all SN.
2. "volov" – /v/, /o/, /l/, /v/ – all SN.
3. "lova" – /l/, /o/, /v/ – all SN.
4. "govor" – /g/, /o/, /v/, /r/ – /r/ is S class, so only 3 SN out of 4. Maybe not enough.
5. "hvala" – /h/, /v/, /a/, /l/ – /a/ is S, so 3 SN out of 4.
6. "ljova" – /lj/, /o/, /v/ – all SN.
7. "golov" – same as first.
8. "volog" – /v/, /o/, /l/, /g/ – all SN.
9. "lovaš" – /l/, /o/, /v/, /a/, /š/ – /a/ and /š/ are not SN. So only 3 SN.
10. "govno" – /g/, /o/, /v/, /n/, /o/ – /n/ is N class. So 3 SN.

Hmm, some of these don't meet the 90% because they have other classes. Maybe I need to find words with more SN phonemes. Let's see:

- "golov" – 4 SN.
- "volov" – 4 SN.
- "lova" – 3 SN.
- "ljova" – 3 SN.
- "volog" – 4 SN.
- "govor" – 3 SN.
- "hvala" – 3 SN.
- "lovaš" – 3 SN.
- "govno" – 3 SN.
- "glav" – 3 SN.

Wait, maybe "glav" is better because it's shorter. It has /g/, /l/, /a/ – /a/ is S, so only 2 SN. Not great.

Alternatively, maybe "golova" – /g/, /o/, /l/, /o/, /v/ – all SN except the last /a/ if it's there. Wait, "golova" is /g/, /o/, /l/, /o/, /v/ – all SN. So that's 5 SN phonemes.

Similarly, "volov" is 4 SN.

I think I need to adjust the list to include words with more SN phonemes. Maybe:

1. "golova" – 5 SN.
2. "volov" – 4 SN.
3. "lova" – 3 SN.
4. "ljova" – 3 SN.
5. "volog" – 4 SN.
6. "govor" – 3 SN.
7. "hvala" – 3 SN.
8. "glav" – 2 SN.
9. "govno" – 3 SN.
10. "lovaš" – 3 SN.

But some of these have only 3 SN out of 4 or 5, which might not meet the 90% threshold. Maybe I need to find longer words or words where most phonemes are SN.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with some non-SN phonemes as long as 90% are SN. For example, a 4-phoneme word needs at least 4 SN, which is 100%. So maybe all words should have all SN phonemes. But that might be too restrictive.

In the previous response, I included words like "volov", "golov", "lova", "ljova", "volog", "govor", "hvala", "glav", "govno", "lovaš". But some of these have non-SN phonemes, like "govor" has /r/, "hvala" has /a/, etc.

Perhaps I should focus on words that consist solely of SN phonemes. Let's see:

- "golov" – /g/, /o/, /l/, /v/ – all SN.
- "volov" – /v/, /o/, /l/, /v/ – all SN.
- "lova" – /l/, /o/, /v/ – all SN.
- "ljova" – /lj/, /o/, /v/ – all SN.
- "volog" – /v/, /o/, /l/, /g/ – all SN.
- "govno" – /g/, /o/, /v/, /n/, /o/ – /n/ is N, so not all SN.
- "glav" – /g/, /l/, /a/ – /a/ is S, so not all SN.
- "hvala" – /h/, /v/, /a/, /l/ – /a/ is S, so not all SN.
- "lovaš" – /l/, /o/, /v/, /a/, /š/ – /a/ and /š/ are not SN.
- "govor" – /g/, /o/, /v/, /r/ – /r/ is S, so not all SN.

So, maybe the best approach is to list words that have as many SN phonemes as possible, even if they have a few from other classes. But the user specified 90%, so for a 4-phoneme word, 4 SN; for 5-phoneme, at least 5 SN (which is 100%). So perhaps all words should have all SN phonemes. But that might limit the options.

Alternatively, perhaps the user is okay with some non-SN phonemes as long as the majority are SN. For example, a 5-phoneme word with 4 SN and 1 from another class would meet 80%, which is less than 90%. So maybe it's better to aim for all SN phonemes.

In that case, the words would be:

1. "golov" – 4 SN.
2. "volov" – 4 SN.
3. "lova" – 3 SN.
4. "ljova" – 3 SN.
5. "volog" – 4 SN.
6. "govor" – 3 SN (but has /r/, which is S).
7. "hvala" – 3 SN (has /a/, which is S).
8. "glav" – 2 SN (has /a/, which is S).
9. "govno" – 4 SN (has /n/, which is N).
10. "lovaš" – 3 SN (has /a/ and /š/, which are S and V).

Wait, but "govno" has /n/, which is N, so not all SN. So perhaps it's better to exclude words with non-SN phonemes. Then, the list would be:

1. "golov"
2. "volov"
3. "lova"
4. "ljova"
5. "volog"

But that's only 5 words. Maybe I need to think of more words with all SN phonemes. Let me try:

- "golova" – /g/, /o/, /l/, /o/, /v/ –
