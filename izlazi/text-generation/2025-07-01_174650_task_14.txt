Okay, so I need to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 70% of its phonemes from the Srednjevisoki (SV) class. Let me break this down step by step.

First, I should recall what the SV class includes. From the user's message, the SV class consists of the following phonemes: /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/. So any word I come up with should have at least 70% of its letters representing these sounds.

Wait, but in Croatian, letters can sometimes represent multiple phonemes, especially when it comes to digraphs like 'č', 'š', 'đ', 'j', 'lj', 'nj'. So I need to be careful about that. For example, 'lj' is a digraph representing a single phoneme /ʎ/, which isn't in the SV class. Similarly, 'nj' is /ɲ/, also not SV. So I should avoid those.

Now, the SV class includes 'č' (/tʃ/), 'e' (/e/), 'š' (/ʃ/), 't' (/t/), 'đ' (/dʒ/), and 'j' (/j/). So letters like 'c' in some contexts might be SV, but in Croatian, 'c' is usually /ts/ or /tʃ/, so it's part of SV. Wait, actually, in the initial list, 'c' is in the Visoki (V) class, so I should be careful. Hmm, maybe I need to double-check the phoneme classes.

Wait, the user provided the classes as:

- Niski (N): /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/
- Srednjeniski (SN): /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/
- Srednji (S): /a/, /k/, /r/, /d/, /dž/, /f/, /ž/
- Srednjevisoki (SV): /č/, /e/, /š/, /t/, /đ/, /j/
- Visoki (V): /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/

So 'c' is in the V class, not SV. So when I see 'c' in a word, it's not SV. So I need to make sure that the letters I use are from the SV class.

So, for example, 'č' is SV, 'e' is SV, 'š' is SV, 't' is SV, 'đ' is SV, 'j' is SV.

So I need to create words where at least 70% of the letters correspond to these phonemes.

Let me think of some common SV letters: 'č', 'e', 'š', 't', 'đ', 'j'. Also, vowels like 'e' are SV, so that's helpful.

Now, I need to make sure that in each word, the majority of letters are from SV. Since 70% is a high percentage, each word should have more SV letters than non-SV.

Let me try to come up with some words.

1. 'čet' - 'č' (SV), 'e' (SV), 't' (SV). All letters are SV. So 100% SV. That works.

2. 'šteta' - 'š' (SV), 't' (SV), 'e' (SV), 't' (SV), 'a' (S). Wait, 'a' is in the S class, so that's one non-SV letter out of five. So 4/5 = 80% SV. That's good.

3. 'đečko' - 'đ' (SV), 'e' (SV), 'č' (SV), 'k' (S), 'o' (SN). So SV letters: 'đ', 'e', 'č' (3). Non-SV: 'k', 'o' (2). So 3/5 = 60%, which is below 70%. Hmm, that's a problem. Maybe I can find another word.

Wait, perhaps 'đečko' can be adjusted. Alternatively, maybe 'đečko' is a less common word. Maybe I can find another one.

4. 'šet' - 'š' (SV), 'e' (SV), 't' (SV). All SV. 100%.

5. 'čest' - 'č' (SV), 'e' (SV),'s' (V). Wait,'s' is in V class. So two SV letters out of three. 66.6%, which is just below 7
