Okay, so I need to come up with 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 60% of its phonemes from the Low (N) class. The Low class includes /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, and /u/. Let me break this down.

First, I should figure out what 60% of the phonemes in a word means. If a word has 3 phonemes, 60% would be at least 2. If it's 4 phonemes, at least 3. So, I need words where most of their sounds are from the Low class.

Looking at the Low class phonemes, they are: /m/, /n/, /nj/, /b/, /p/, /u/. So, I can use these sounds to form words. Let me think of some common words in Croatian that have these sounds.

For example, "mama" – that's /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/. Wait, but /a/ isn't in the Low class. Hmm, maybe that's not the best example. Let me think again.

"množiti" – /m/, /n/, /ož/, /i/. That has /m/ and /n/, which are Low, but the rest aren't. So maybe that's not good enough.

Wait, maybe I should look for words that start with /m/ or /n/ since those are Low. For example, "mrtvi" – /m/, /r/, /t/, /v/, /i/. Only the first letter is Low. That's not enough.

How about "nogomet" – /n/, /o/, /g/, /o/, /m/, /e/, /t/. So /n/ and /m/ are Low. That's two out of seven phonemes. Not enough.

Hmm, maybe I need to focus on shorter words. Let's see.

"mam" – /m/, /a/, /m/. Only two Low phonemes out of three. 66%, which is above 60%. So that could work. But wait, "mam" isn't a standard word. Maybe "mama" – /m/, /a/, /m/, /a/. Two out of four. 50%, which is below 60%. So that's not enough.

What about "mno" – /m/, /n/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%, which is good. But "mno" is a word meaning "many" in some contexts. Maybe that's acceptable.

Another one: "mud" – /m/, /u/, /d/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%. Good.

"mub" – /m/, /u/, /b/. All three are Low. 100%. That's excellent.

"mup" – /m/, /u/, /p/. All three are Low. 100%.

"mna" – /m/, /n/, /a/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%.

"mnb" – /m/, /n/, /b/. All three are Low. 100%.

Wait, but some of these might not be real words. For example, "mup" – is that a word? I'm not sure. Maybe I need to check.

Alternatively, I can think of real words that fit. Let me think of some real Croatian words.

"mrtvi" – but as before, only one Low phoneme.

"množ" – /m/, /n/, /ož/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%.

"mudri" – /m/, /u/, /d/, /r/, /i/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%. Not enough.

"mamut" – /m/, /a/, /m/, /u/, /t/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

Hmm, maybe I need to focus on shorter words. Let's try again.

"mud" – real word meaning "mud". /m/, /u/, /d/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%.

"mno" – as before, maybe acceptable.

"mub" – not sure if it's a word.

Alternatively, "mima" – /m/, /i/, /m/, /a/. Two Low phonemes out of four. 50%.

Not enough.

Wait, maybe "mam" – but it's not a word.

Alternatively, "man" – /m/, /a/, /n/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%.

Yes, "man" is a word meaning "man". So that's good.

So, compiling the list:

1. mno – 66%
2. mud – 66%
3. mub – 100% (if it's a word)
4. mup – 100% (if it's a word)
5. mna – 66%
6. mnb – 100%
7. man – 66%
8. mrt – /m/, /r/, /t/. Only one Low phoneme. Not enough.
9. mda – /m/, /d/, /a/. One Low phoneme. Not enough.
10. mbo – /m/, /b/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of three. 66%.

Wait, but some of these might not be real words. I need to make sure they exist.

Alternatively, I can use "množ" – but it's three letters, two Low phonemes. 66%.

Another word: "mbr" – not a word.

"mbs" – no.

"mnb" – not a word.

Hmm, maybe I need to focus on real words.

So, "man" – real word.

"mud" – real word.

"mno" – real word.

"mub" – not sure.

"mup" – not sure.

So, maybe I can find 10 real words. Let me think again.

"mam" – not a word.

"mama" – 50%.

"množ" – 66%.

"mud" – 66%.

"man" – 66%.

"mbr" – no.

"mbs" – no.

"mnb" – no.

"mbo" – two Low phonemes.

"mko" – /m/, /k/, /o/. Only one Low phoneme.

"mlo" – /m/, /l/, /o/. One Low phoneme.

Hmm, this is challenging. Maybe I need to include longer words where the percentage can still meet 60%.

For example, "mnogo" – /m/, /n/, /o/, /g/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

Not enough.

"mram" – /m/, /r/, /a/, /m/. Two Low phonemes out of four. 50%.

"mrna" – /m/, /r/, /n/, /a/. Two Low phonemes out of four. 50%.

"mbrko" – /m/, /b/, /r/, /k/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

Not enough.

"mudro" – /m/, /u/, /d/, /r/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe I can use "mama" as a word with two Low phonemes out of four. 50%. Not enough, but maybe I can find another word.

"mamut" – two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

"mambo" – /m/, /a/, /m/, /b/, /o/. Three Low phonemes out of five. 60%. That's good.

So, "mambo" – 60%.

That's one word.

Another idea: "mambo" – 60%.

"mambo" is a real word, I think.

Another word: "mudar" – /m/, /u/, /d/, /a/, /r/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

No.

"mudar" – no.

"mudro" – two Low phonemes.

"mudar" – same.

Wait, maybe "mudar" is not a word.

Alternatively, "mudar" – maybe a surname.

Not sure.

Alternatively, "mudar" – not a standard word.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe "mudar" is a word. Let me check.

No, I think it's not a standard word.

Alternatively, "mudar" – maybe a dialect word.

I'm not sure. Maybe I should avoid it.

Alternatively, "mudar" – no.

Wait, maybe "mudar" is a word in some dialects, but I'm not sure.

So, perhaps "mambo" is the only one I can think of so far.

Another idea: "mambo" – 60%.

Another word: "mbrko" – but only two Low phonemes.

Wait, "mbrko" – /m/, /b/, /r/, /k/, /o/. Two Low phonemes out of five. 40%.

Not enough.

Hmm.

Wait, maybe "mud
