Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to create 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 70% of its phonemes from the "Visoki (V)" class. First, I need to understand what the Visoki class includes. From the user's message, the Visoki class consists of the phonemes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/.

Wait, that seems a bit off. In Croatian, /c/ is pronounced like 'ch' in "church," /ć/ is like 'ts' in "bits," /z/ is 'z' as in "zoo," /s/ is's' as in "see," and /i/ is the vowel 'i'. So, these are all consonants except for /i/, which is a vowel. 

Now, each word needs to have at least 70% of its phonemes from this class. Let's break that down. If a word has, say, 5 phonemes, 70% of 5 is 3.5, so at least 4 phonemes need to be from V. Similarly, for a 4-phoneme word, 70% would be 2.8, so at least 3 phonemes from V.

But wait, the user's initial message had a list of phoneme classes, but the Visoki class includes /ć/, /i/, /c/, /z/, /s/. So, that's 5 phonemes. The other classes are Niski, Srednjeniski, Srednji, Srednjevisoki. 

I need to make sure that each word I create has at least 70% of its phonemes from the Visoki class. So, I should focus on using as many of these phonemes as possible. However, I also need to make sure that the words are valid in Croatian. So, I can't just string together random phonemes; they have to form actual words.

Let me think of some possible words. Maybe starting with 'ić' which is a common suffix in Croatian, like in'mađić' or 'dušić'. But I need longer words. Let's see:

1. 'ićići' – but that doesn't seem like a real word. Maybe 'ićić' is a name, but not a common word. Maybe 'ići' is a plural form, but I'm not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should look for words that have multiple 'i's or 'ć's. For example, 'ićić' is a surname, but I'm not sure if it's a valid word. Alternatively, 'ići' could be a plural, but I'm not certain.

Alternatively, maybe 'ćiril' – but that's a name, not sure if it's a standard word. 'Ciril' is a name, but perhaps 'ćiril' is a variation. Hmm.

Wait, maybe I should think of words with 'c' and's'. For example, 'čas' – but that's Srednjevisoki (SV) class. So, that's not helpful. 'Sic' – that's a word, meaning 'yes' in some dialects, but it's a short word. 'Sic' has two phonemes:'s' and 'i'. So, both from V. So that's 100%, but it's too short.

Wait, the user didn't specify the length of the words, just that each word must have at least 70% of phonemes from V. So, even a two-letter word can qualify if both letters are from V. But perhaps the user wants longer words.

Alternatively, maybe 'ićić' – but I'm not sure if that's a real word. Alternatively, 'ići' – but again, not sure.

Wait, perhaps I should think of words with multiple 'i's. For example, 'ići' – but I'm not sure. Alternatively, 'ićić' – maybe a surname.

Wait, perhaps I should look for words that have 'c' and's' in them. For example, 'čas' – but that's SV. 'Sic' is V, but it's short. 'Sics' – not a word. 'Cisc' – not a word.

Alternatively, 'ićić' – perhaps a name. 'Ići' – that's a verb, meaning 'to go', but it's in the infinitive form. Wait, 'ići' is the plural form of 'ić', which is a noun meaning 'edge' or 'border'. So, 'ići' is a valid word, and it has two 'i's and one 'ć'. So
