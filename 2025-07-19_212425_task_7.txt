Okay, so the user wants me to generate 10 Croatian words where each word has at least 60% of its phonemes from the Srednjeniski (SN) class. The SN class includes /v/, /g/, /o/, /h/, /l/, /lj/. 

First, I need to understand what 60% means. For a word with, say, 5 phonemes, 60% would be 3 phonemes. So each word needs to have at least 3 SN phonemes. 

I'll start by looking for common words that have multiple SN phonemes. Maybe words with 'g', 'v', 'l', or 'lj'. 

Let me think of some words. "Gol" has 'g', 'o', 'l' – all SN. That's 3 out of 3, so 100%. Good. 

"Vlak" has 'v', 'l', 'a', 'k'. Wait, 'a' is S, 'k' is S. So only 'v' and 'l' are SN. That's 2 out of 4, which is 50%. Not enough. Maybe a longer word. 

"Vlaga" has 'v', 'l', 'a', 'g', 'a'. 'v' and 'l' are SN, 'g' is SN, so that's 3 SN out of 5. 60%. Perfect. 

"Glavni" has 'g', 'l', 'a', 'v', 'n', 'i'. 'g', 'l', 'v' are SN, so 3 out of 6. 50%. Not enough. Maybe "glavno"? 'g', 'l', 'a', 'v', 'n', 'o'. 'g', 'l', 'v', 'o' are SN. 4 out of 6. 66.6%. Good.

"Vozilo" has 'v', 'o', 'z', 'i', 'l', 'o'. 'v', 'o', 'l' are SN. 3 out of 6. 50%. Not enough. Maybe "vozlište"? 'v', 'o', 'z', 'l', 'i', 'š', 't', 'e'. 'v', 'o', 'l' are SN. 3 out of 8. 37.5%. No good.

"Glavni" was 50%, so maybe I can find another. "Vlak" was 50%, but maybe "vlakovi"? 'v', 'l', 'a', 'k', 'o', 'v', 'i'. 'v', 'l', 'o' are SN. 3 out of 7. 42.8%. Still not enough.

Hmm, maybe "vlagar" – 'v', 'l', 'a', 'g', 'a', 'r'. 'v', 'l', 'g' are SN. 3 out of 6. 50%. Close, but not enough.

Wait, maybe "vlagar" is 3 SN out of 6, which is 50%. Not enough. Maybe "vlagar" is not the right word. Let me think of another.

"Vlak" is 2 SN out of 4. Maybe "vlaksa" – 'v', 'l', 'a', 'k','s', 'a'. 'v', 'l' are SN. 2 out of 6. 33%. No.

Maybe "vlagar" is the closest, but it's still 50%. So perhaps I need to adjust the words to have more SN phonemes.

Alternatively, maybe "glavni" can be extended. "Glavno" was 66.6%, so that's good. Let me check another word.

"Vozlište" was 37.5%, which is too low. Maybe "vlasnjak" – 'v', 'l', 'a','s', 'n', 'j', 'a', 'k'. 'v', 'l' are SN. 2 out of 8. 25%. No.

Wait, "vlak" – maybe "vlaksa" is too short. Maybe "vlaksa" is not the right word. Let me think of another.

"Vlagar" – maybe that's the best I can do for now. It's 50%, which is close but not enough. Maybe I need to adjust the word to include more SN phonemes.

Alternatively, maybe "vlagar" can be adjusted. Maybe "vlagar" with an extra SN phoneme. But I can't think of a way right now.

So, perhaps I'll include "vlagar" as one of the words, even though it's 50%, but maybe the user will accept it as a suggestion. Alternatively, maybe I can find another word that meets the criteria.

Wait, "glavni" was 50%, but "glavno" was 66.6%. So "glavno" is good. Let me think of another word.

"Vlak" is 50%, so maybe "vlaksa" is not the right approach. Maybe "vlagar" is better, but it's still 50%.

Hmm, perhaps I need to look for words with more SN phonemes. Maybe "vlagar" is the best I can do for now. I'll include it as a suggestion, but note that it's 50%.

Wait, but the user asked for 60%, so 50% is not enough. So maybe I need to adjust the words to have more SN phonemes.

Alternatively, maybe I can find a word with 4 SN phonemes out of 6, which would be 66.6%. Let me think.

"Glavno" has 4 SN phonemes out of 6. That's good. Let me think of another word like that.

"Vlaga" has 3 SN out of 5, which is 60%. That's acceptable.

"Glavni" is 50%, so maybe I can find another word that has 4 SN out of 6.

"Glavno" is good. Maybe "glavnoj" – 'g', 'l', 'a', 'v', 'n', 'o', 'j'. 'g', 'l', 'v', 'o' are SN. 4 out of 7. 57%. Close, but not 60%.

Alternatively, "glavnoj" is 57%, which is still below 60%.

Hmm, maybe "glavno" is the best I can do for now. Let me think of another word.

"Vlagar" is 50%, so maybe I can find another word with more SN phonemes.
